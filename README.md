# mxn-favicons

**mxn-favicons** is a fork of [**connect-favicons**](https://github.com/theworkers/connect-favicons), a simple **connect** middleware to serve site icons (favicon.ico and apple-touch-icon.png and all its flavours) from any directory.

## Install

```
$ npm install mxn-favicons
```

## Usage

Use it like this in your rollup.config:

```js
// HTTP / HTTPS servers
const http  = require("http");
const https = require("https");

// MXN Connect Framework
const connect = require("mxn-connect");

// Instantiating the App
const app = connect();

// Adding Middleware
const logging = require("mxn-logger");
const favicon = require("mxn-favicons");
const sstatic = require("serve-static");

app.use(logging);
app.use(favicon(__dirname + "/public/icons"));
app.use(sstatic(__dirname + "/public"));

// Respond to all requests
app.use(function(req, res) {
    res.end("Hello from MXN Connect!\n");
});

// Create node.js http server and listen on port
const options = { };
const server = http.createServer(options, app)
                   .listen(3000, function()
{
    console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});

server.on("error" , function(error) {
    console.error("Error event handler called: " + error);
});
```

## Connect/Express Middleware

These middleware and libraries are officially supported by the Connect/Express team:

  - [body-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body-parser) - previous `bodyParser`, `json`, and `urlencoded`. You may also be interested in:
    - [body](https://www.npmjs.com/package/body)
    - [co-body](https://www.npmjs.com/package/co-body)
    - [raw-body](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raw-body)
  - [compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/compression) - previously `compress`
  - [connect-timeout](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-timeout) - previously `timeout`
  - [cookie-parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-parser) - previously `cookieParser`
  - [cookie-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookie-session) - previously `cookieSession`
  - [csurf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/csurf) - previously `csrf`
  - [errorhandler](https://www.npmjs.com/package/errorhandler) - previously `error-handler`
  - [express-session](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session) - previously `session`
  - [method-override](https://www.npmjs.com/package/method-override) - previously `method-override`
  - [morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan) - previously `logger`
  - [response-time](https://www.npmjs.com/package/response-time) - previously `response-time`
  - [serve-favicon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-favicon) - previously `favicon`
  - [serve-index](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-index) - previously `directory`
  - [serve-static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-static) - previously `static`
  - [vhost](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vhost) - previously `vhost`

Most of these are exact ports of their Connect 2.x equivalents. The primary exception is `cookie-session`.

## Legacy Middleware

Some middleware previously included with Connect are no longer supported by the Connect/Express team, are replaced by an alternative module, or should be superseded by a better module. Use one of these alternatives instead:

  - `cookieParser`
    - [cookies](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookies) and [keygrip](https://www.npmjs.com/package/keygrip)
  - `limit`
    - [raw-body](https://www.npmjs.com/package/raw-body)
  - `multipart`
    - [connect-multiparty](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-multiparty)
    - [connect-busboy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-busboy)
  - `query`
    - [qs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/qs)
  - `staticCache`
    - [st](https://www.npmjs.com/package/st)
    - [connect-static](https://www.npmjs.com/package/connect-static)
